        "-   The return statement in a Python function serves to terminate the     function's execution and optionally provide a value back to the caller. When a return statement is encountered, the function immediately stops running, and the specified value, if any, is passed back as the result of the function call. If no value is explicitly specified, it implicitly returns None. The return statement enables functions to produce output that can be utilized in other parts of the program, facilitating modularity and code reusability.\n",

        "-   An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values. An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values. Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__() .\n",

        "6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "-   A generator function is a special type of function that returns an iterator object. Instead of using return to send back a single value, generator functions use yield to produce a series of results over time. This allows the function to generate values and pause its execution after each yield, maintaining its state between iterations.\n",

        "- Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, primarily related to memory efficiency and lazy evaluation. Unlike regular functions that return a complete result set, generators produce values one at a time, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets or infinite sequences without exhausting memory. This \"lazy evaluation\" means processing only the data needed at the moment, and resuming from where the generator left off when called again.\n",
